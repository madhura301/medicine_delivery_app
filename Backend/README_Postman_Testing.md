```
Error: Could not get any response
```
**Solution:**
- Ensure the API is running: `dotnet run --project MedicineDelivery/MedicineDelivery.API`
- Check if the API is accessible at `http://localhost:5000`
- Verify the `base_url` variable in Postman

#### 2. **"401 Unauthorized" Error**
```
Status code is 401
```
**Solution:**
- Ensure authentication tests run first
- Check if the `auth_token` variable is set
- Verify the admin user credentials are correct

#### 3. **"500 Internal Server Error"**
```
Status code is 500
```
**Solution:**
- Check the API console for detailed error messages
- Ensure the database is properly configured
- Verify all required packages are installed

#### 4. **"404 Not Found" Error**
```
Status code is 404
```
**Solution:**
- Check if the API endpoints are correctly configured
- Verify the API is running the latest version
- Ensure the route paths match the controller endpoints

#### 5. **Photo Upload Tests Failing**
```
Invalid photo file format
```
**Solution:**
- The collection includes sample base64 images for testing
